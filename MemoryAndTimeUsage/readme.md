## ‚è±Ô∏è Measure Processing Time

### ‚úÖ Method 1: Using `App::finish()`

Logs how long the full request takes:

```php
$timeStart = microtime(true);

App::finish(function() use ($timeStart) {
    $diff = microtime(true) - $timeStart;
    $sec = intval($diff);
    $micro = $diff - $sec;

    Log::debug(Request::getMethod() . "[" . Request::url() . "] Time: " . round($micro * 1000, 4) . " ms");
});
```

### ‚úÖ Method 2: Around a specific block (e.g. DB query)

Measure time for a specific code block:

```php
$start = microtime(true);

// your code here...

$time = microtime(true) - $start;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Method 3: From Laravel start

Quick way to check how much time passed since app started:

```php
var_dump(microtime(true) - LARAVEL_START);
```

Keep it light, log only when needed ‚úÖ
