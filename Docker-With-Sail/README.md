# üöÄ Laravel Sail with WSL2 & Docker Setup Guide

## Introduction

**Docker** üê≥ is a lightweight virtualization tool that packages code and its dependencies into containers, making it easy to run and scale applications. **Laravel Sail** ‚õµ, introduced in December 2020, is a simple CLI tool for managing Docker environments tailored for Laravel projects. With Sail, you can seamlessly set up and manage your Laravel app using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **Redis**‚Äîall without deep knowledge of Docker.

**WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** üêß allows developers to run Linux environments directly on Windows, without the overhead of traditional virtual machines (VMs). **WSL 2** brings significant performance improvements over its predecessor, offering faster file I/O and more efficient integration.

   ```

2. **Enable Virtual Machine Feature:**
   ```bash
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
   ```

3. **Download the Linux Kernel Update Package:**
   [Download here](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).

4. **Set WSL 2 as Your Default Version:**

## ‚õµ Let's Sail with Laravel

1. Open **PowerShell** and select **Ubuntu** from the menu.
2. Navigate to your directory:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
3. Create a new folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir foldername
   cd foldername
   ```

4. Install Laravel using the following command:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://laravel.build/newapp | bash
   ```

5. Navigate to the new Laravel directory:
   ```bash
   cd newapp
   ```

6. Start Laravel Sail:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail up
   ```

If you face issues, ensure your antivirus software isn't blocking Docker files. Exclude the directory: 
`C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop\vm-data\`.

## üåê Running the Project

Once the Sail container is up and running, access your Laravel project in your browser at:
```bash
http://localhost
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Daily Sail Commands

- **Start Sail in detached mode**:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
   ```

- **Stop Sail**:
  - Option 1: Use `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
  - Option 2: Run the command:
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail down
    ```

## ‚ö° Helpful Alias for Sail

You can simplify running Sail commands by creating a Bash alias:
```bash
alias sail='bash vendor/bin/sail'
```

Now you can start Sail with just:
```bash
sail up
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Visual Studio Code Integration

Make sure you are in the correct project directory, then run:
```bash
code .
```

---

## üõ¢Ô∏è Connect with SQL Management Tools

To connect with tools like **HeidiSQL**, use the following credentials:

- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Username**: `sail`
- **Password**: `password`

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Performance Issues**: Ensure that **WSL 2** and **Docker** are correctly configured.
- **Antivirus Conflicts**: Make sure to exclude Docker directories in your antivirus settings to avoid conflicts.
